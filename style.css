/* Distance between text and border is the padding while distance between the border and the next element is the margin */
/* margin increases the space in between elements, by using just margin, it adds the px space to all sides - 4:30*/
/* Addresing the parent is less specific, addressing an element is more specific, addresing a class is more specific than an element, and when you have a set of code twice, whichever thing comes last will take place */
/* An id is more specific than a class, no matter where its placed + you should only use an id once, while a class you can use more than once */
/* px=pixels ... vh=height ... vw=width */
